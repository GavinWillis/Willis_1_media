I still dont have much; it plays sound but not when i brake the beam, so it 
just plays sound by itself without control.

I accomplished about the same amount as last week, there was just moe sound 
this week.

The only thing left to do is to make the sound play when the IR braker beam 
is broken.

I will probably have the same thing to turn in if i am not able to figure out
the code for it.
