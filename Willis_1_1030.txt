We use disk images in Digital Forensics because we dont want to mess up disk
that is suspected to have stuff on it, if we make an image of it, we can mess 
up as many copies of an image without ruining the original. 

Like if we have a criminals hard drive and we need to look at the stuff thats
on it without accidentaly deleting or corrupting any files. So we would make 
an image of the hard drive to be able to do stuff with the criminals 
information. 

It relates to the OSI model because hard drives are on the physical layer.
