Blender doesnt really appeal to me, but animation in 3Ds Max appeals to me just 
because i like it better and i feel like i can use it more efficiently. The 
animation process appeales to me because i have so many things i can do in an 
animation that you cant really accomplish in anything else.

I am eally struggling on actually using blender. It just doesnt really make 
sense to me and the key strokes with some of the preset controls.

I guess i would like to focus on learning how to use blender, because i dont 
really know how to use blender very well.
