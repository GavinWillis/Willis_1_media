I am working on getting the arduino to play a not every time i brake the IR beam.

The challenges i am facing are just codeing issues because i have never 
coded in C before.

I will try and accomplish my set goal which is to make something play if the IR 
beam is broken.

I will need help with the code because there is nothing really out there on 
the internet to help me do what i am trying to do.

I will hopefully have it almost working by the end of the week.
