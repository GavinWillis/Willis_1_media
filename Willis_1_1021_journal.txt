A beat is a repeated rhythmic pattern usually represented by a drum.
We will use this too keep time in our EarSketch music art project.


A variable is a value that can be changed at any time. We could use variables 
in our music to change the beat and change the pitch of a noise.

A datatype is any data used in a program.
